> input and output in python

## Intro
Python provides several built-in modules for working with files and serializing data in JSON format. In this section, we will explore how to read and write files in Python, and how to use the json module to parse and serialize JSON data. We'll cover basic file I/O operations, advanced techniques for working with large files, and best practices for handling JSON data in Python
