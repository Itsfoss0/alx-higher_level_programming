        This [Resource](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/python-tutorial-list-comprehension-examples/) helped me understand list compression better. 





        ## Exercises 
        1. Given a list of numbers, remove floats (numbers with decimals)
        2. Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7
        3. Count the number of spaces in a string
        4.  Create a list of all the consonants in the string “Yellow Yaks like yelling and yawning and yesturday they yodled while eating yuky yams”
        5. Get the index and the value as a tuple for items in the list “hi”, 4, 8.99, ‘apple’, (‘t,b’,’n’). Result would look like (index, value), (index, value)
        6. Find the common numbers in two lists (without using a tuple or set) list_a = 1, 2, 3, 4, list_b = 2, 3, 4, 5
        7. Get only the numbers in a sentence like ‘In 1984 there were 13 instances of a protest with over 1000 people attending’
