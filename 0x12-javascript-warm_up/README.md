## Javascript
JavaScript, a high level single threaded garbage collected intrepreted or just in time compliled  prototyped based multiparadigm  weakly dynamic typed programming language with a non blocking event loop, famous for building websites. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 in just one week to add scripting functionalities to the netscape browser.

## Background context
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
