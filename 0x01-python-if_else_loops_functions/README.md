> program control structures - if statements, loops and functions 

## Intro 
In this module, we will explore control structures in python (branching and looping) and functions 

## Resources 
1. [Flow control](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
2. [IndentationError](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QXOd2ZQs-Q)
3. [String formating](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3)
4. [Looping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swQEbZ6ez1I&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt&index=2)
