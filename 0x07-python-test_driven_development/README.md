## Intro 
Starting from today:
- Based on the requirements of each task, __you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first__, before you actually code anything

- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases

- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. __But not in the implementation of them!__

- __Don’t trust the user__, always think about all possible edge cases
