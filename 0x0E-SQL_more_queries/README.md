## About 
While SQL is a powerful language for managing data, it also has many intermediate concepts that can be used to create more complex and nuanced queries. Example of such include __Joins__, __Subqueries__ , __Aggregate Functions__ __Window Functions__, __Views__ and __Stored Procedures__ Lets explore the most common of them in this project.
