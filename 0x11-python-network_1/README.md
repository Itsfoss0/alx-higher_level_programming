> Python Networking #1


## About
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to transfer data over the internet. Python provides several modules for working with HTTP, including the built-in ```http.client``` module, the popular ```requests``` library, ```urllib``` package  and the asyncio-based ``aiohttp`` library. In this project, we will get our hands dirty with urllib and request.

Lets jump right in
