> Inheritance in python

## About 
Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. This allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class, without having to rewrite the entire class from scratch. Other than saving you a lot of time and effort, it also  helps you to avoid duplication of code. Stay hooked as we dive into how to implement inheritance in python.
