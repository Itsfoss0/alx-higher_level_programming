## Intro 
In this session, we will explore OOP in python. OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed below. 

## Resources

2. [Introduction to OOP](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php)
3. [Properties vs. Setters vs. Getters](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php)
4. [Learn to program - part 9 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE&)
5. [Python classes and objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s)

## More info
### Documentation is mandatory
Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments see [example](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)

### Script requirements
- Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```
- All your modules should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```)
- All your classes should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'```)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'``` and ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'```)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
