## Practice Exercises
Practice exercises on classes and OOP in general in python. [[solution](./0-class.py)]

1. Write a Python program to create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage instance attributes
2. Create a Vehicle class without any variables and methods
3. Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class

    Given Vehicle class is defined as

```python
class Vehicle:

    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage
```
