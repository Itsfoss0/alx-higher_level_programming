## About
jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, animation, and Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) interactions for web development. It was released in 2006 by John Resig and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries used by web developers. In this project, we will take a deep dive into Jquery to understand how to use it for the above mentioned functionalities and even more. Overall, jQuery is a powerful and widely-used tool for web development that can help simplify many common tasks and streamline the process of building interactive web applications.

## Concepts
For this project, look at the following concepts
- [JavaScript in the browser](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/3)
