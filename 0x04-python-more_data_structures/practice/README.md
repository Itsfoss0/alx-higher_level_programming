>Practice lambda functions, map, filter and reduce in python.

## [lambda practice ](https://www.google.com/search?q=lambda+functions+in+python)
- [X] What are lambda functions

         Short anonymous functions 
         Take any number of arguments
         Perform one expression on the 
         arguments and return the evaluated value

- [X] Why use lambda functions

        When using functions as arguements in other HOF eg map, filter, reduce etc. 

- [X] The general syntax 

        lambda argument(s) : expressions

- [X] Limitations of using lambda functions

        only perform one expression

### Exericises 
1. Write a Python program to create a lambda function that adds 15 to a given number passed in as an argument. 
2. Write a function which takes two arguments: a and b and returns the multiplication of them: a*b
3. Write a Python program to find if a given string starts with a given character using Lambda
4. Write a Python program to extract year, month, date and time using Lambda
5. Write a Python program to check whether a given string is number or not using Lambda
6. Write a Python program to create Fibonacci series upto n using Lambda
