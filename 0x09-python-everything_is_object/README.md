## Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, letâ€™s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to? I mean:
```
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>> 
```

OK, But what about this?
```
>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
>>> 
```

## Learning objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to [explain](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/) to anyone the following concepts without the help of Google.

* [X] What is an object
* [X] What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* [X] What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* [X] What is a reference
* [X] What is an assignment
* [X] What is an alias
* [X] How to know if two variables are identical
* [X] How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* [X] How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* [X] What is mutable and immutable
* [X] What are the built-in mutable types
* [X] What are the built-in immutable types
